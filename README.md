# GiantsSteps
A Unity game where the user guides a ball through a series of rapidly evolving landscapes.

## Intro
The idea is to build a video game around triangulated meshes and the mathematics that describe them.  Such meshes provide infinitely adaptable ever-changing landscapes tiled with triangular prisms over which the user would have only limited control.  They would struggle to craft that landscape to get the ball where it needs to go.

## Installation
The Unity Project portion of this repo is in `BabySteps`.  You'll want to open that directory with your Unity install.  This code was build largely in Unity version 2018.4.10f1

This project requires [https://github.com/mattatz/unity-triangulation2D](https://github.com/mattatz/unity-triangulation2D) for high quality DeLaunay triangulation.  There you will find a `Triangulation2D.unitypackage` file which you'll want to drag into your Unity Assets.
